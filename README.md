# Buying an IR camera for 1300 and 1550nm range

This is a list of camera manufacturers:
* Thorlabs
* Newport
* DataRay
* EdmundOptics
* Spiricom
* ElectroPhysics
* BaySpec
* Andor Technology
* Princenton Instruments


## Thorlabs
CCD and CMOS cameras from [Thorlabs](http://www.thorlabs.com) are only for VIS-NIR range (400-900nm typical, some reach 1100nm).


## Newport
Only one model covers required ranges: LBP4 beam profiler. Manufacturer declares that camera covers 350-1310 & 1550nm range. It is a CCD camera with an additional conversion coating (phosphorous?) sensible at 1550nm+/-50nm.

## DataRay
Dataray cameras are available at three ranges: standard (350-1150nm), -1310 model (350-1350nm) and -NIR model (1480-1680nm).
